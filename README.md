# rogue-pickings-responsive

Hi there!
This is a project I did from Skillcrush. I was responsible for creating the static version of the PSD file.
You can take a look at the static version here: https://veemae.github.io/Rogue-Pickings/. Later on, I was tasked to make the site responsive, which is what you'll see in this repository. You can also view the responsive version here: https://veemae.github.io/rogue-pickings-responsive/.
